# MediBrief TODO List

This document outlines planned enhancements and features for the MediBrief project.

## Video Generation with Runway Gen-2 API

### Overview
Integrate Runway's Gen-2 API to enhance video generation capabilities with AI-generated scenes, providing more professional and engaging visual content for medical paper summaries.

### Implementation Tasks

1. **API Integration**
   - [ ] Set up Runway Gen-2 API authentication
   - [ ] Create API client wrapper with rate limiting and error handling
   - [ ] Implement token management and usage tracking
   - [ ] Add configuration options in `config.yaml`

2. **Prompt Engineering**
   - [ ] Develop a system to convert paper content into effective Runway prompts
   - [ ] Create templates for different types of medical content (clinical trials, case studies, etc.)
   - [ ] Implement prompt optimization based on medical specialty
   - [ ] Design a feedback loop to improve prompt quality based on results

3. **Scene Generation**
   - [ ] Create title sequences with paper information
   - [ ] Generate visual representations of medical concepts
   - [ ] Develop specialized prompts for different paper sections (abstract, methods, results, etc.)
   - [ ] Implement style consistency across generated scenes

4. **Integration with Existing Content**
   - [ ] Develop methods to incorporate extracted figures and charts from papers
   - [ ] Create text overlay system for key points and clinical relevance
   - [ ] Implement blending techniques between AI-generated scenes and static content
   - [ ] Design transitions between different content types

5. **Post-Processing Pipeline**
   - [ ] Add subtitle generation synchronized with narration
   - [ ] Implement scene composition to create a cohesive video
   - [ ] Develop audio-visual synchronization system
   - [ ] Create quality assurance checks for generated videos

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Implement caching for commonly used scenes or templates
   - [ ] Develop parallel processing for multiple scene generation
   - [ ] Create fallback mechanisms when API is unavailable
   - [ ] Optimize for cost efficiency (token usage)

### Technical Requirements

- Add Runway API client library to `requirements.txt`
- Create new module `video_generation/runway_generator.py`
- Update orchestrator to support Runway video generation as an option
- Extend configuration schema to include Runway API settings
